When your micro's main clock frequency is software configurable, why not set it exactly to what you want?

REQUIREMENTS:
-------------
libftdi
mspgcc
mspdebug

USAGE:
------

By default, this will determine the constants for 16MHz.
1) Download, extract, etc and run make. If this does not work, check that the requirements are fulfilled.
2) Flash the program to your chip, something like (for the LaunchPad)

mspdebug rf2500 'prog UART_CALIBRATION.elf'

3) Run the host calibration program

./host_calibrate

4) You will see a long stream of characters. See the source for details.
At the end you will see the DCO and BCSCTL1 constants printed.

5) If you want to recalibrate, reset your micro via a reset button or

mspdebug rf2500 'reset'

and run step 3 again.

BACKGROUND:
-----------

This is a combination of two programs, one on the host, and one on the micro, that communicate to each other to get the DCO to a target frequency.

Supported host hardware:
FTDI USB Serial adapters

Supported micros:
MSP430 series

Basically you have to modify the source to set the target frequency you want. If your FTDI adapter is not based on FT230X, you will have to change the USB ID to your adapter's ID.
